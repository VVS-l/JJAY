            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>Yo, it's JJAY or you might know me as Quaze or whatever my persona is on social media lol. This page is for the people who want to know more about me, so you know me more than just a "Producer" from YouTube.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>How Did I Get Into Music?</h2>
                <p>Honestly, I grew up surrounded by music thanks to my parents and siblings. They played old-school music, mostly Hip-Hop and R&B, and my family has a long history in music. My dad was a rapper and breakdancer, making all kinds of music. My uncle was a producer, meeting huge artists and even working with them. My brother, who is an amazing rapper, can freestyle and create a ton of songs a day. He’s my biggest inspiration for rap and music in general. My family is why I make music—I want us to go places together.</p>

                <p>I started getting into music at age 7 when I downloaded an app that let me freestyle over a beat. From there, I got into different genres and taught myself to sing, rap, and produce. In 2020, I discovered BandLab and started using autotune and posting music. In 2022, I made my first "beat" (7 seconds long, super basic, but I was proud of it). I made a second, slightly better beat that same day. I didn’t have access to DAWs back then, just BandLab, but I made do with what I had. My first computer helped me start making beats, but they were bad—just loops with 808s and drums. I even tried remaking a Dababy beat, but it was terrible. I took a break from making beats in June 2022 and focused on my rap persona. But in June 2023, I started making beats again and got more consistent.</p>

                <p>Fast forward to 2024, and I released my debut mixtape on December 1st, after making it in October. I started posting more consistently again. My most recent track is about Jesus and God—no cursing because it didn't fit the vibe. That’s pretty much how I got into music!</p>

                <h2>What Do I Use?</h2>
                <p>I use BandLab for my rap persona and FL Studio for beats. I prefer FL Studio because other DAWs confuse me. My setup doesn’t require a super powerful PC; a laptop works fine. I don’t use any interfaces, just my keyboard and mouse.</p>

                <h2>My Lifestyle</h2>
                <p>To start with my younger years, my childhood was good. We moved a lot, but the reason is Detroit was getting very bad. My family had enough with the killings and cult bullcrap so we just dipped and stayed in this small town for like 10 years. But back to my younger years it was good, I did okay at school, made a huge group of friends, they were mostly girls because at that school I didn't really talk to most of the boys, I didn't really fw them like that at the time. But in highschool they were cool. and I'm talking about the ones who were trouble makers. the chill ones I made I still talk/hangout/chill with everyday, we just a friend group of 3 at this point. I don't know what to put here for lifestyle, it was good and there really isnt much to put.</p>

                <h2>My Childhood</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Detroit. It had its good and bad sides. There was a lot of violence, but the people were nice, and my family stayed close. We moved to a rural area for a while. I had some country friends there, and we’d do things like climb trees and play PlayStation. One time, we started a fire that almost burned down the forest—no one got in trouble, but my parents were mad. I don't know, this could be like a year later or a could months later but  a tornado hit our area, and my family had to take shelter in a church bathroom. It was an E3 tornado, so the church got damaged, but luckily, our house was untouched. After that, we stayed at a hotel for a while, before moving out of there to somewhere else.</p>
